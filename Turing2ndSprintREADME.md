# Turing's Data Analytics Sprint Project: 2

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, dear reviewer(s)! 

First, here is the link to my Sales Dashboard [Sales Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15bMnlUZ1Y7fQHvX0oeaG1ChwI6RsQaWboY8p9ndQdJI/edit?usp=sharing)

## A few notes

#### 1. The purpose of the Dashboard
This dashboard is meant to familiarize AdventureWork's stakeholders with sale trends and patterns. The dashboard covers:
* Sales by revenue, volume, country, and reason;
* Delivery performance;
* Top salespeople by sale volume and revenue;
* Sales by platform (online vs. online);
* Volume vs. revenue proportion;

Most of the charts can be filtered by country from a single point at the top of the dashboard. *However*, there are two charts are **not** affected by the filter, namely: 'sales by country' and 'top 4 salepeople'. While the former chart isn't affected by the filter because by design, the latter one is the consequence of my ignorance in how to reveal top values in pivot charts.

**The main goal of this dashboard** is to reveal patterns through monthly, yearly and all-time comparisons.

#### 2. Personal noteworthy mention
It was fascinating to first create the monthly chart, then follow it up with sales reason *and then* also add a revenue vs. volume chartâ€”because all three reveal an intimate connection between themselves: from noticing an uptick in sales, to understanding the reason, to establishing how it affected the factual order count and revenue increase.
